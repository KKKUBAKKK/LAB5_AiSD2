The task involves navigating a maze represented as a 2D array with `S` as the start, `E` as the end, `X` as walls, and `O` as paths. The goal is to find the shortest time to reach the end from the start under different scenarios: moving only on paths, using unlimited dynamite to destroy walls, using just one dynamite, and using exactly `k` dynamites. The expected complexity varies by scenario, and the solution should also return the path as a string of directions (`N`, `S`, `E`, `W`).
